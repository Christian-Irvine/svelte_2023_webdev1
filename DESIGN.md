## Satisfactory Website
[Link](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/)

The first website I looked at is the Satisfactory Website for the factory building and simulating game Satisfactory. The reason I chose this site because I really like the game Satisfactory and its aesthetic and that applies onto the website also.

### Design Principles
One thing that the website does is have the header at the top of the screen. In the header it also contains the nav bar which are both principles of modern web design.

Continuing on from that when you turn the page into a phone size it changes the nav bar to be inside of a hamburger menu. This enables it to be less crammed and cluttered when mobile users are using the site.

It also has segments as you scroll down the page. Each segment alternates between a dark and brighter colour to differentiate between them.

It also moves images more inwards and upwards as you scroll further down the page to have a form of fade in effect which is very nice.

### Incorporating

The big element I incorporated from the Satisfactory website is the segments as you scroll down. This helps differentiate between them and makes the site less straining to look at

I also did the same thing with the Hamburger menu when the site is in moble user mode to ensure it is less cluttered and to display the nav properly and not off the screen.
