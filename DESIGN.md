## Satisfactory Website
[Link](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/)

The first website I took inspiration from is the Satisfactory Website for the factory building and simulating game Satisfactory. The reason I chose this site because I really like the game Satisfactory and its aesthetic and that applies onto the website also.

### Design Principles
One thing that the website does is have the header at the top of the screen. In the header it also contains the nav bar which are both principles of modern web design.

Continuing on from that when you turn the page into a phone size it changes the nav bar to be inside of a hamburger menu. This enables it to be less crammed and cluttered when mobile users are using the site.

It also has segments as you scroll down the page. Each segment alternates between a dark and brighter colour to differentiate between them.

It also moves images more inwards and upwards as you scroll further down the page to have a form of fade in effect which is very nice.


### Incorporating

The big element I incorporated from the Satisfactory website is the segments as you scroll down. This helps differentiate between them and makes the site less straining to look at

I also did the same thing with the Hamburger menu when the site is in moble user mode to ensure it is less cluttered and to display the nav properly and not off the screen.

## Trade Me Website

The second website I took inspiration from is Trade Me. I chose this site because I liked its more minimalistic colours and its generalised layout of the page.

### Design Principles

The first thing the Website follows modern principles for is the logo in the top left corner. Not only that but clicking on this link brings you back to the home page which is a very common aspect of a lot of websites and is almost expected.

Another thing they do is have a very minimal theme. It has a lot of colours but they are all flat plain colours with no borders to be very clean. They also use a lot of white and off white where the colours are as to not draw the eyes but not strain them either.

They also have logos in their footer with links to their social media. This is much nicer than text as its easily recognisable and is far more cleaner which fits with their style.

### Incorporating

I took inspiration from this site with all three of the above elements. First I took the top left corner and put in a big "ME" text which is what the website is about. And to get back to the home page that is what you click on to get there.

The second thing is the minimal theme. I took an even more minimal approach by picking a nice blue colour (similar to their secondary yellow colour) and used primarily that for coloured sections. I also used similar off white colours as them and this worked very well with the segments from the Satisfactory site as it gave me colours to pick for it.

Thirdly I also used logos in my footer. These link to my social media pages and the github repo this project is stored in. They are very simplistic so work with my theme while also being clear what they are for
