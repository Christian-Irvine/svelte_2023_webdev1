## Satisfactory Website
[link](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/)

The first website I looked at is the Satisfactory Website for the factory building and simulating game Satisfactory. The reason I chose this site because I really like the game Satisfactory and its aesthetic and that applies onto the website also.

### Design Principles
One thing that the website does is have the header at the top of the screen. In the header it also contains the nav bar which are both principles of modern web design.
