            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>
                The name CraftyMCFish originated on 2016. I wanted to change my username to 'MCFish' however,
                that name was already taken so I decided to take the 'Crafty' part of my old username and slap it on the front to form 'CraftyMCFish'.

                The channel was founded on the 7th Febuary 2017. At the beggining the videos consisted of animations made in Mine-Imator every week.
                These videos were rather short, only being around 30 seconds long. I would spend about 3 hours on each video sometimes a little longer sometimes a little shorter.
                Slowly over the few months of making them the quality began to improve. Though it wasn't long before I stopped.

        <h3>AncientCraft</h3>
        <p>
            After the animations I moved onto making Minecraft Lets Plays on the server I was currently on called "AncientCraft".
            My fellow players had suggested the idea to me and lots of them I still know today.

        <h3>My Own Server</h3>
        <p>
            At one point I started my own Minecraft Server called "FishMC" (yes I know how original) and it is still going to this day! Though I did pass it on to some of the players,
            but they have kept it alive this whole time.

        <h3>OmathaCraft</h3>
        <p>
            Eventually AncientCrafts time came to an end, but a few people were invited to another server called OmathaCraft (me included). 
            The most notable thing I did on there was digging a big hole documented by the video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekBDeKwy86I" target=_blank>"i dug a hole"</a> above.
