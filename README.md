# 2023 Intro Web Assignment

## Description

This project is an assignment of my first go at web development. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a multi page website based around the theme of me. I chose this theme because it gave me a way to put a few of my hobbies and interests into one place to display them to whoever was interested in it. I used a website for this task because it was the best way to display the information I wanted to show. And it was a good practice for future web endeavours. Some of the biggest challenges with this project was learning how to use a framework rather than just vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript which I have lightly touched on in the past.

## The Framework

For this project I used the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/ "kit.svelte.dev") framework because it is a lot more powerful and once you are used to it more intuitive from a programming perspective than vanilla web design. The biggest part of using SvelteKit over vanilla is the ability to have components which can be reused to allow for more DRY code.

## How To Use

To run the program first you need to have node packet manager installed. Once that is done inside of the project folder open a terminal and run the `npm i` command (short for `npm install`). Once it has finished installing to run the dev build you can run the `npm run dev -- --open` command and it will open in your browser. Or if you want to run a build of it run the `npm run build` command.
