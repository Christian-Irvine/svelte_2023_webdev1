# 2023 Intro Web Assignment

This project is an assignment of my first go at web development. Using HTML CSS and JavaScript. It is a multi page website based around the theme of me. I chose this theme because it gave me a way to put a few of my hobbies and interests into one place to display them to whoever was interested in it. I used a website for this task because it was the best way to display the information I wanted to show. And it was a good practice for future web endeavours.
